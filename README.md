# Realm support

We are going to keep track of issues via this Github repo. 

If you come across any issues while using Realm, please post details [here](https://github.com/holium/realm-support/issues/new/choose).


## Updates

### `v.0.0.58`
- disable next button on the Install Realm step while the loader is visible
- disable click on spaces selector while it is in it's loading state
- fixes bazaar recommended app bug in spaces. If someone didn't have a catalog entry for an app when it was recommended, they could experience a crash when clicking on the home button on the spaces home screen.
