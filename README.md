## Changelog

### `v0.0.66` - 12/22/22
- group / spaces member sync: add, invite, kick, etc
- bazaar app install fixes
- bazaar app host is set properly
- added a number badge to the rooms button so people can see if there is anyone in a room at a glance.
- When a ship is added to space -> ship is added to group and receives an invite for that group.
- When a ship is added to space -> ship receives an invite to the space. May want to refactor spaces so that a ship can simultaneously be added to a space and invited to the space (in %groups ship doesn't actually have to accept before being added as a member).
- Fixes issue where app catalog entries are not shared properly on joined-bazaar.
- Fixes install statuses to emulate the pre-OTA stable install process
- Fixes issue with host being an empty unit.
     - adds poke to manually set a host if a null unit is present
- Sync %spaces and %groups members by @leowini
- Fix context menu overflowing near bottom of screen by @gdbroman
